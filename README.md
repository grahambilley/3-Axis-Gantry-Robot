This began as a passion project to solve an issue we have at Arbor Botanicals. 3-axis gantry robots are commonly used in the cannabis industry to fill vaporizer cartridges, however they are pailful to program and require highi-precions milled holders to avoid issues when filling. I wanted to make a gantry robot that uses computer vision to detect the edges of the cartridges and would direct the dispensing needle to thwe correct position automatically. To do this, I decided to build my own gantry robot using a Raspberry Pi 4, NEMA 17 stepper motors, and various other circuit components. This project is a work in progress.
