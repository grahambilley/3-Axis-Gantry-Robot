This began as a passion project to solve an issue we have at Arbor Botanicals. 3-axis gantry robots are commonly used to fill vaporizer cartridges, however they are painful to program and require highly precise machined trays to hold the cartridges individually in order to avoid issues when filling. I wanted to make a gantry robot that uses computer vision to detect the edges of the cartridges and would direct the dispensing needle to the correct position automatically. To do this, I decided to build my own gantry robot using a Raspberry Pi 4, NEMA 17 stepper motors, and various other circuit components. This project is a work in progress.
